     * @brief RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, as an alternative to SigV4.
     *
     * @par
     * A port of the euclid server's Core::HttpSignature, kept deliberately line-for-line - see the
     * note on CDK::SigV4 for why the two have to agree byte for byte.
     *
     * @par
     * Same job as SigV4 and the same credentials - an access key ID names the key, its secret
     * access key is the HMAC key - but the standard, non-AWS way of saying it: what the signature
     * covers is listed explicitly in a Signature-Input header, the signature itself is base64 in a
     * Signature header, and the body is bound in through a Content-Digest header (RFC 9530) rather
     * than through a hash header only AWS clients know to send.
     *
     * @par Fixed policy
     * Like SigV4 here, the covered component list is not client-negotiated: a signature must cover
     * exactly CoveredComponents(), in that order, or it is rejected. RFC 9421 leaves the choice to
     * the signer, which would let a MITM strip a component from both the signature base and the
     * header it is presented in and still verify - the same downgrade the SigV4 implementation next
     * door refuses.
     *
     * @par Algorithm
     * hmac-sha256 only. The asymmetric algorithms RFC 9421 also defines need a public-key
     * distribution story euclid does not have; the access key secret both sides already share is
     * exactly an HMAC key.
     *
     * @par The "tag" parameter
     * Neither signed nor required. euclid's server emits no "tag" and never looks at one, so a
     * verifier that insisted on a particular tag would reject the server's own signatures. A
     * signature that carries one is accepted here and the tag ignored, which is what lets this
     * interoperate with a signer that adds one.
